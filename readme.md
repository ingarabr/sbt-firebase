# Notes 
```
Note: For your default Hosting site, the SITE_NAME is your Firebase project ID (which is used to create your Firebase subdomains SITE_NAME.web.app and SITE_NAME.firebaseapp.com).
If you’ve created multiple sites in your Firebase project, make sure that you’re using the SITE_NAME of the site to which you’d like to deploy.
